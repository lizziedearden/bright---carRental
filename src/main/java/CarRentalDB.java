//Friday Team Project
//Implement a car rental management system cli program.
//
//CAR MANAGEMENT
//- The user should be able to add new cars including daily price for renting
//- The user should be able to remove cars if not being rented
//- The user should be able to list available cars for rent
//- The user should be able to list rented cars
//
//RENTAL
//- The user should be able to book a car
//- The user should be able to return a car
//4 Things to take into consideration:
//Create a class called CarRentalDB:
//- You should have one property that can store a list of cars with corresponding details
//- Create a public method for adding a car to the list
//- Create a public method for deleting a car from thethe list if car exists
//- think about other methods that your application needs
